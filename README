Heart Attack & Gender Gap Investigation
Overview:
This project explores the gender gap in heart attack risk using a real-world health dataset from Kaggle. The primary goal was to investigate why men are more likely to experience heart attacks than women by analyzing biological and lifestyle factors like cholesterol, smoking, and blood pressure.

Phase 1: Data Exploration & Visualization
1. Cleaned and balanced the dataset to include equal numbers of male and female participants (n = 470 each)
2. Explored distributions of key features using histograms, box plots, violin plots, and correlation heatmaps
3. Identified smoking and systolic blood pressure as potential contributors to the gender gap in heart attacks 

Phase 2: Machine Learning
1. Built two machine learning models to predict heart attack risk:
    Logistic Regression: Simple and interpretable
    Random Forest Classifier: More complex and accurate
2. Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score
    Found that while both models predicted low-risk cases well, the Random Forest model was better at detecting true heart attack cases
    Feature importance analysis confirmed that smoking and blood pressure were the most influential predictors

Key Findings
- Men had higher rates of smoking and elevated systolic blood pressure, which aligned with higher heart attack rates
- These lifestyle factors likely explain much of the gender difference in cardiovascular risk
- Machine learning can serve as an early-warning tool for predicting heart attack risk and guiding prevention strategies
